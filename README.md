# dynamic-notepad

Little project to improve my web development (on Flask, in this case) skills. Inspired on the website https://www.invertexto.com/notepad

The project consists on a basic python made notepad with data permanence on a database. I made a localhost database with postgresql, but you'll have to put your database URI on the __init__.py configurations, if you want to test it.

You can generate your own link for your notepad and access it everytime from the site's URL. The project uses a dynamic routes system.

The repository counts with the virtual enviroment for the program's execution, in addition to the requirements.txt file with all the required libraries to the project.

The project was an ability test about my python and flask knowings, after i have made a flask course (that does not teaches the project that i made, but a little online shop system). It helped me to improve experiences about dynamic routes, ORM, SQL (with postgres), circular imports, softwares refactoring, etc. Please consider the... not so pretty interface. This project had a bigger focus on the back-end working, although i have interest on remake him on a... prettiest way.

Hope you like it!
